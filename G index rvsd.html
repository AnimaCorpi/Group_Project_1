        <p><strong>These semi-aquatic species considered a hoax which belived to have been created by attaching several other animal parts to create one. This species is threatened facing extinction. Today there are only two-kinds of semi-aquatic mammels left on the planet that are egg-laying. Almost all mammals give birth to live young except for this species. This species lay's eggs that hatch as live young.  Native to Eastern Australia's colder highlands and tropical forests as well as New Guinea. Usually located in small streams and their surrounding areas spending most of their time in the frsh-water along side their home adjacently burrowed into the water or riverbanks.</p></strong> 
        <p><strong>This endangered species are one of the three main groups classified as one in five living "monotremes" that are currently near extinction living today.  Identified as a spiny anteater. These semi-aquatic mammals hunt fresh-water crustaceans like shrimp, crayfish and have been known to eat a frog or insect on occasion.   These awesome animals are nocturnal as well as crepuscular (active during twilight) sunset and sunrise. They are as elusive as they are effective hunters due to their electroreceptors that locate food in search of prey. This adaptaion is considered unconventional when you compare the hunting methods of other species who require the use of their ears and eyes.</p></strong>    
    <br>
        <h1><b> Do You Know Who They Are</h1></b>
            
        <p><strong>Platypuses (Ornithorhynchus anatinuswere) thought to be unique as it bewildered scientist. Australian mammal noted for its odd combination of primitive features and special adaptations, especially the flat, almost comical bill that early observers thought was that of a duck sewn onto the body of a mammal.  Platypuses have what we would consider a sixth sense. They are electroreceptors located in their bills and this is how they locate their prey.  More importantly, they do not have teeth or acid producing stomachs. Their  gullet is directly attached to their intestines.  This is were they digest gravel to grind down their food.  They do store both food and gravel in their hamster like cheeks or sacs in which, once they surface they then munch on them.</p></strong> 
    <br>
            <h1><b>HISTORY</h1></b>
    <br>
        <p><strong>Platypuses length start at 38 to 30 cm (15-24"); males genreally are larger than females. However, recent discovery of a single playtapus tooth was shown to indicate a prehistoric platypus measuring  over 3 foot long. The female Platypus is even more pecular because they can give birth to baby puggles which, hatch from their eggs using an egg tooth, and are completely blind and hairless.  More over, is how the females mammary glans created for milk production produces no teats.  Their milk emerges from pores in the skin of the abdomen where the puggles then lap up.  They have odd skeletal features that are archaic robust sholder girdle and short, with a wide humerus giving them extensive muscle attachement add exceptionally strong four limbs.  Adding to its distinctive appearance are conspicuous white patches of fur under the eyes. The fur on the rest of the body is dark to light brown above, with lighter fur on the underside.  Their aquatic adaptations include long guard hairs protecting the soft underfur keeping them insulated and dry.  Two layers of waterproof fur providing insulation by trapping air next to their skin keeping them warm but also boyant underwater as they hunt the bottom of the water way.  The playtapus is also equipped with a biofluorescence while in the presence of blacklight will glow a blue-greencolor.  As of today scientist have not uncovered as to how they are capable of this mechanism. Their extensive webbing on the front feet extends past their claws which allow them to propell through the water. Their tail acts as the stabalizer while their back feet act like rudders and brakes while they swim. Primarily the tail is used for fat storage. Make no mistake that they are equipped with a spur on the inner side of each ankle that is connected to a venom gland located above the thighs.  Platypus spurs defense is its venom that is potent enough to kill small animals causing intense pain in humans.</p></strong>  

        <p><strong>Platypuses are solitary animals. By 2008 a full genome was documented that the DNA of the Platypus contained shared profiles of reptiles, birds, and mammals. This could account for their odd appearances and unusual characteristics.   Is the Platypus kind of a beetle?</p></strong>
<br>
       <h1><b>EVOLUTION</h1></b>

        <P><strong>Aquatically asgaped platypus similar to the monotremes mostlikely evolved from more generalized terrestrial monotreme.  The first fossile recored recorded was about 110 million years ago early Cretaceous Period when Australia was connected to South America located in Anarctica. The Platypus family consists of Ornithorhynchidae Monotrematum 
        Ornithorhychus Monotrematum and Obdurodon also the echida a spiny anteater including the short-beaked echidna and the long-becked echidnas are some relatives in the family tree.</p></strong>
            
<br>        
       <p><strong> However, the life of the platypus is challenging. Platypuses can live up to 17 years in the wild and less in captivity.  They are elusive to avoid their predators such as crocodiles, dogs, eagles, foxes, goannas, snakes and water rats. More importantly, is the human threat to their habitat created from contributions such as deforestation, and land clearing for farming pressuring the freshwater that disrupts their ecosystem.  This forces them onto land as it destroys their homes no safe place to bed.  Drought that is shrinking the habitat by drying up the water ways.  In addition, to dehydration. Thus forces them to land where they become vunerable to the land predators.  Pollution is another huge destruction of their habitat as the water ways become enidated with rubbish, wire, pipes including hydroelectric turbines in streams.  All these issues contribute to entrapment and death.</p></strong>

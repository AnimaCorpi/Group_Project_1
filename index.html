        <p>The Platypus is one of five extant species of egg-laying mammals in the a class of Monotremata and only living species within the family ornithorhynchidae. Platypus, (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), also called duckbill, a small amphibious Australian mammal noted for its odd combination of primitive features and special adaptations, especially the flat, almost comical bill that early observers thought was that of a duck sewn onto the body of a mammal. Adding to its distinctive appearance are conspicuous white patches of fur under the eyes. The fur on the rest of the body is dark to light brown above, with lighter fur on the underside.</p> 

        <p>Platypuses length start at 38 to 30 cm (15-24"); males genreally are larger than females.  They have odd skeletal features that are archaic robust sholder girdle and short, with a wide humerus giving them extensive muscle attachement add exceptionally strong fomr limbs.  Their aquatic adaptations include long guard hairs protecting the soft underfur keeping them insulated and dry.  Their extensive webbing on the front feet extends past their claws which allow them to propell through the water. Their tail acts as the stabalizer while their back feet act like rudders and brakes while they swim. Make no mistake that they are equipped with a spur on the inner side of each ankle that is connedted to a venom gland located above the thighs.  These spurs defend and the venom is potent enough to kill small animals causing intense pain in humans as well if their spur penetrates the skin. Playpuses are solitary.</p>

        <p> Playtpus is found in the Austalian Alps to lowland areas close to the sea.  Occasionaly will swim in salt water, however must feed in fresh water, where its electrical navigation system is operative.  Present in all eastern Austalian staes both eastward-westward-flowing river systems however non-existent from far northeren Queensland not like its relatives echidnas whom have colonized the island of New Guinea.Platypuses are common in waterways of eatern Australia, considered bottom-dwelling invertebrates, but ocassionaly eat a frog, insect or insect on the waters surface.  The creature does forage actively dick to dawn while it shelters in burrows during the day as it is dug into stream banks.  It has been quipped with a flattened toprpedo like body, dense enought to repel water with its water proof fur, and it front strong limbs capa le of digging as well as for swimming.  The heas is stramlined so each ear housed in a groove togehter with a small eye.  It sensed of sight, smell and hearing are essentilaly shit down while it is submered to feed, inspite of its unique electromechanical system of electrpreceptors that also toruch and nvaigate perfectly underwater. </p>

        <p>Aquatically asgaped platypus similar to the monotremes mostlikely evolved from more generalized terrestrial monotreme.  The first fossile recored recorded was about 110 million years ago early Cretaceous Period when Australia was connected to South America located in Anarctica. The Platypus family consists of Ornithorhynchidae Monotrematum 
        Ornithorhychus Monotrematum and Obdurodon also the echida a spiny anteater including the short-beaked echidna and the long-becked echidnas are some relatives in the family tree.</p>
